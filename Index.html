                Real-world data from diversied domains like medical, biology, security, banking,
                social networking, web-data, news articles show breaches of several of these assumptions.The weakness of the machine learning algorithm in failing to generalize becomes all the more clear when tried on the real word datasets. In current state of time, the involvement of machine learning in our day-to-day life has increased to an remarkable extent. To maintain and escalate its relevance, the classification paradigms have to be robust to the breach of the assumptions which exist in the real world data. In datasets from medical domain, a quantitative disparity exists in the cardinalities of different classes. A class may contain a signifcantly higher number of instances than another. Such a disproportion in the dataset biases the classifier towards the quantitatively abundant class.
